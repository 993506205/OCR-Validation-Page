        <p class="lead">Text Search Web Application project was built in the Django framework and Pytesseract Python module. This thesis project was made in four main parts. The first part is the Django framework. Django is an open-source web framework based on Python language. It lightens the workload of designing database-driven websites. The second is MongoDB which is a Not Only Structured Query Lan-guage (NoSQL) database. With the help of MongoDB, the scanned files can be stored in a file storage system locally that will reduce the stereo matching time and the information storage significantly. The third is Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX), a set of web development techniques. AJAX helps project POST data from web forms to the backend server when Django was not able to complete this. The last is the Pytesseract Python module. The Pytesseract is an optical character recognition tool for Python. It extracts the text data from image files. It is a wrapper for Googleâ€™s Tesseract-OCR Engine and in this thesis, it de-ploys words extracting and fetching positions in files as a simple module.</p>
